    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // const team = players
    // team[3] = "Other"

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = "Others";

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = "Other"

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Other";

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
      name: 'John',
      age: 28,
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const captain = {...person};

    const person2 = {
      name: 'John',
      age: 28,
      social: {
        linkedIn: 'johnnunns',
        facebook: 'john - nunns'
      }
    }

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person2)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
